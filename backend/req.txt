create a express server and a smart contract for a IoT authentication system using blockchain. You have to follow the requirements below.

1. The system should use the bubble of trust approach.
2. The contract should allow registration and login using deviceId and password. However, only an admin will be able to register devices. Also both deviceId and password should be uint type.
3. The express server should use the ethers library and it should also have separate routes for registration and login.
